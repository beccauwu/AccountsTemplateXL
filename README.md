# Excel template with winforms data entry for bookkeeping

## (only purchases and single entry atm)

just me messing around making something for several days to make it easier to do a 3h job ^^'

could end up being useful in the end though, after it's been massively generalised and made into a proper app (planning on adding the option to pick an excel file instead of it being an addin/template).

structure is also very messy it needs some massive cleanup after i get it properly working
